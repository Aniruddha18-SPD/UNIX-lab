<h1> Simple Ceasar Cipher </h1>

Simple Ceasar Cipher is one of the simplest techniques for data encryption and decryption. The idea of a Caesar cipher is this: you encode a message by shifting each letter some number of places. Thus, if the shift is 2, then A becomes C, B becomes D, and so on.

This project implements this concept with the use of Python. The entire code was written and compiled in vi editor instead of using a nice Integraded Development Environment (IDE) like MSCode, or Atom, Repl.it. The sole purpose of doing this project was to be familiar with coding incase software engineering tools like these aren't available. Besides the use of the editor, git was used to manage the code, and push any working/compilable code increments and the final code to github.
